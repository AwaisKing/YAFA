# YAFA

**YAFA (Yet Another File Archiver)** is an experimental archiver, created for educational purpose.

This tool's idea was sparked by few students of **Quaid-e-Awam University of Engineering & Technology** *(QUEST)*, 17 batch of IT.

This is mere a hobby project.


> **NOTE:** THIS **DOESN'T** DECREASE FILE SIZE OR COMPRESS FILES! IT DOES THE **REVERSE** (INCREASES SIZE), AS IT IS JUST A TEST TOOL.
